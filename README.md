📊 Mental Health Dataset Analysis
🧠 Overview
Mental health is often an invisible struggle, yet it profoundly affects productivity, relationships, and overall well-being. In this project, I explored a mental health dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that could help raise awareness and drive data-informed conversations around mental well-being.

This analysis was part of my learning journey as a data analytics student, combining skills in Python, data visualization, and storytelling to bring numbers to life.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdsultanulislamovi/student-stress-monitoring-datasets)

Description: The dataset includes variables such as sleep quality, work hours, stress levels, social life rating, and overall mental health scores.

Size: X rows × Y columns

Period Covered: YYYY – YYYY

🎯 Objectives
Understand the distribution of mental health scores.

Identify factors influencing stress and well-being.

Visualize patterns across demographic and lifestyle variables.

🔍 Analysis Process
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values.

Standardized categorical labels.

Removed duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics.

Correlation analysis.

Trend identification.

Data Visualization:

Bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.

Heatmaps for correlation.

Comparative charts for different lifestyle factors.

📊 Key Insights
Sleep Quality Matters: People with higher sleep quality scores had significantly lower stress levels.

Work Hours Impact: Stress levels sharply increased for individuals working more than 50 hours/week.

Social Life & Well-being: A strong positive relationship between social life rating and overall mental health score.
